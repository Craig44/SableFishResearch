# Tagging data and studies {#tagdata}
Since 1972 there have been approximately 400 000 sablefish tagged in Alaska waters, of which over 38 500 have been recovered. Although there is extensive and long term tagging data, this information is not currently directly included in the stock assessment [@goethel2021assessment].


Historical publications investigating movement of Alaskan sablefish include @heifetz1991movement, @hanselman2015move

## Exploratory analysis of tag data {-}

Figure \@ref(fig:TagReleases) shows the spatial distribution of both releases and recaptures, which both have fairly broad spatial distributions which is a good attribute. Figure \@ref(fig:recoveriebygear) shows the number of recoveries by gear method and year, this highlights a major drop off in recoveries from the Longline gear with no other gear has picked up in. This will have to be discussed with the wider team. In particular, what years to consider this data to be informative.

```

```



We applied a simple Lincoln-Peterson estimators to view changes in abundance over the area of interest using a subset of the tag recoveries. The Lincoln-Peterson estimator follows

\[
\widehat{N} = \frac{n e^{-(\kappa + M)}K\tau}{k} \ .
\]

+----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Most of the tags are released during the summer survey (Figure \@ref(fig:TagDataByMonth)) but recoveries are more spread out within a year.

```{r TagDataByMonth, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%", fig.height=5,fig.cap="Tag recovery and release distributions by month",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c(file.path("Figures","Releases_by_month.png"),file.path("Figures","Recoveries_by_month.png")))
``` 


An initial Lincoln-Peterson estimator used on line tag recoveries that were at liberty for a year (300 - 420 days). This time-at-liberty period was chosen so we could explore trends in biomass in exploitation rates to compare with the assessment. Due to the large distance traveled by sablefish over this time-period (Figure \@ref(fig:KMtravelled)), the spatial extent was the entire stock region.


```{r KMtravelled, out.width= '60%',fig.height= 3.4, fig.cap = "Distance (km) between release location and recovery location for fish at liberty for a year.", echo = F, eval = T}
include_graphics(file.path("Figures", "distance_travelled_after_a_year.png"))
```


A few calculations/approximations are needed to be made to estimate \(K\) which will be the catch scanned for tags over the time period of interest and adjusting the catch for tag detection and reporting rates. We also will want to account for tag-loss and or tag induced mortality which assumed to be 10\% each year. Reporting rates are based on the work by @heifetz2001estimation. The period for calculating total catch was the 15 of May to 15 of September. This was chosen as it brackets the monthly peak of releases (Figure \@ref(fig:TagDataByMonth)). The other adjustment was converting reported weight into numbers. For this I calculated the mean numbers of fish per tonne based on the observer data. I then used this multiplier for the catch reported in tonnes during the period to exrtract the numbers caught by the fishery and thus assumed checked for tags.


```{r popestimateslincolnpeterson, out.width = '60%',fig.height= 3.4, fig.cap = "Recovered fish by gear type and year", echo = F, eval = T}
include_graphics(file.path("Figures", "LincolPetersonEstimates.png"))
```

Once we have annual population estimates we can make derive a rough annual exploitation rate (\(U_y \)) denoted by 

\[
U_y  = \frac{C_y}{\widehat{N}}
\]
where, \(C_y\) is the annual catch in numbers for the Longline fishery shown in Figure \@ref(fig:roughExploitationRate).

## Integrating tagging observations in spatial age-structured models {-}

This project intends to explore a range of methods for utilizing tag-recovery observations in spatially disaggregated age-structured stock assessments.

## Tagging things to consider with relevant references {-}

## Releasing tags {-}
Tag release events involve releasing a tag-cohort at the beginning of a year within a specific area. A tag cohort is indexed by \(k\) and has an implied year \(y\) and region \(r\) index. \(\boldsymbol{N}^k\) is used to denote a vector of lengths or ages for tag-cohort \(k\). In general, only the length frequency is known at time of release for each tag-cohort becasue ageing is a fatal process. We consider two different approaches for seeding a tag cohort within spatial age-structured models. The two methods are essentially the same but differ in whether the length are converted to age outside of the model ("External") or done within the model ("Internal"). The internal method requires users to supply length frequency for each tag-cohort and the model will use the assumed growth assumptions and sex ratios to convert the lengths to ages. The external approach will use an age-length key outside of the model to derive an age frequency that can then be supplied to the model. 

A frequent assumption of age-structured tagging models in the literature [@maunder1998integration;@vincent2020parameter] is that the age-frequency of each tag-cohort is known. Due to the fact that ageing is a fatal process, we assume they have used the external approach. If the age-length key is representative, then this method is expected to be very similar and have better computational performance. Factors to consider at time of release are; gear method used to select releases, where releases occur, and time of releases. If growth is estimated within the assessment model, then the internal method may be prefered to keep the growth assumptions consistent between LF observations and other model quantities.


One down fall of the internal approach is tag releases and recoveries are both length-based inputs. Due to age-structured modelling growth as length conditional on age. Moving individuals back and forwards through the age-length transition matrix (length $\rightarrow$ age $\rightarrow$ length) will cause "smearing" of length frequencies. This is demonstrated in Figures \@(ref:addagelength) and \@(ref:showagelengthtransition_problem), and needs to be considered when considering model fitted values for observations and corresponding likelihood assumptions. Given this phenomenon, we make the argument that the external age-length key approach should be used. The external method means we assume (there actually is error in this) the ages of released fish and time at liberty, thus we know the age at recovery.

#### Internal method {-}
Age-structured stock assessment models contain growth models, which describe length conditioned on age. This requires assumptions on the distribution and associated parameters. The default is often the normal distribution with mean length at age denoted by \(\bar{l}_a\) with standard deviation parameterised as a coefficient of variation (\(\sigma_a = cv*\mu_a\)). This information enables the model to derive a growth transition matrix \(P_{l|a}\). Given the lower and upper limits for each length bin denoted as \(\boldsymbol{b} = (b_1, b_2, \dots, b_{max})'\), the probability of being in length bin \(l\) given age \(a\)

\begin{equation}
P_{l|a} = 
\begin{cases}
\Phi(b_{l + 1}|\mu_a,\sigma_a)\quad &\text{for } l = 1\\
\Phi(b_{l + 1}|\mu_a,\sigma_a) - \Phi(b_l|\mu_a,\sigma_a)\quad &\text{for } 1 < l < n_l\\
1 - \Phi(b_{l}|\mu_a,\sigma_a)\quad &\text{for } l = n_l
\end{cases}
  (\#eq:agelengthtransition)
\end{equation}


where \(\Phi(x|\mu,\sigma)\) is the cumulative normal (but could be generalised to any probability distribution). If growth varies by attributes such as sex, stock or region then this will need to be calculated for each growth model.

At the point a tag cohort is released, the model can derive the length composition of the vulnerable population using the transition matrix derived in Equation \ref(eq:agelengthtransition). Given the number of estimable parameters that govern the age-stricture at a point in time and growth model, an exploitation rate is calculated so that if there are not enough numbers in a length bin to be tagged, a penalty can be added to the objective function to dissuade the combination of parameters that generated this situation. Tag-release by length is a known quantity and so the model must allow for a minimum vulnerable length composition to that released. To enforce this, an exploitation rate by length \((u_l)\) is calculated as follows,
\begin{equation}
u_l = \frac{N^k_{l}}{\sum_a}N_{y_k,a,r_k} P_{l|a}
  (\#eq:lengthexploit)
\end{equation}

During parameter estimation there are no constraints within the model to trial a set of parameters that will allow \(u_l > 1\) i.e., more observed tag-releases than in the available population. To stop negative numbers at age, \(u_l\) is set at a level less than 1 and a penalty added to the objective function to discourage parameters from allowing this condition. Finally, tag-release at age is calculated as follows,
\begin{equation}
N^k_{a} = N_{y_k,a,r_k}  P_{l|a} u_l
  (\#eq:tagatagerelease)
\end{equation}

Once the tag cohort are created in the model it is assumed that tagged fish are exposed to the same dynamics as un-tagged fish. **Revisit this** we will want to explore mixing behaviour/assumptions.


#### External method (Age-length key method) {-}
Once a tag-release event has occurred for tag group \(k\), the only known knowledge is the length distribution \(N^k_l\). Assuming there is an accessible forward age-length key which describes the proportion of ages for a given length bin \(\left(P_{a|l}\right)\) that is representative of the vulnerable population to tagging for the same area and time, then the "forward" or "classic" key method can be used @ailloud2019general. If tag-release coincide with a fishing season you could use fishery-dependent derived age length information, assuming the selectivity curves within a length bin are parallel. If only a subset of fish from each haul are released, it would be better to construct an age-length key from a representative sample of fish that were caught but not-tagged. This would be relevant for single vessel survey release events.
\begin{equation}
	N^k_a = \sum\limits_{l = 1}P_{a|l}N^k_l
\end{equation}
where, \(N^k_a\) is used as an known input into the model with no error. **Revist** can we account for uncertainty here?


### Things to consider for tag release {-}

- we don't have much information regarding sex of tagged fish (36.5\% of recovered tags have sex information). Does this lean towards the internal method? can allocate sex ratio based on vulnerable population which may be important, if there is quite a difference in sex disaggregated selectivities.


## Tag recovery observations {-}
There are two types of tag-recovery observations that we will consider in this work, tag-release conditioned and tag-recapture conditioned. This conditioning relates to whether we relate recoveries to the release event or whether we only look at the recoveries relative to other recoveries within a time period [@vincent2020parameter;@mcgarvey2002estimating]. This conditioning relates more to the log-likelihood formulation rather than the model expected values. We should also explore two different approaches regarding the scanned fish of which tag-recoveries are a subset. The first is recoveries were entirely from a fishery which requires some understanding or assumptions on reporting rates. The other method assumes scanned fish are known, which is the approach used in the Casal2 [@doonan2016casal2] stock assessment program. This information can be recorded if the scanning is done either by observers who are recording LF's for the catch or scientific/trained staff when shed sampling landed catch. Both these scanning approaches will require an assuming or information on detection rates.

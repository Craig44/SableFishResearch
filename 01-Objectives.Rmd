# A list of objectives/milestones that we have set along the project life {#objectives}


- [ ]  Translate current stock assessment (Chapter \@ref(modeldescription)) from ADMB to TMB. Planned date of completion is December 1 2022
- [ ]  Conduct self test using TMB model. Planned date of completion is December 1 2022
- [ ]  Consider improvements i.e., sex disaggregated composition data or sex ratio observations (look at the rock lobster assessment) including age-length observations or tag-increment observations to estimate growth internally.
- [ ]  Characterize both fishery and survey data to get an idea of data limitations when considering spatially explicit stock assessment model.
- [ ]  Develop a spatially explicit estimation model in TMB that generalizes the current assessment model. This requires a lot of thought, especially how we want to integrate the tagging data (Chapter \@ref(tagdata))

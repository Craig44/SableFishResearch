"The average length of an age-1 juvenile sablefish tagged in southeast Alaska is 31- 35 cm. Because of the known-age (age-1) of juvenile sablefish, these tagging studies are especially unique and provide valuable information that differs from the tagging of adults on the longline survey" Katy Echave tag documentation

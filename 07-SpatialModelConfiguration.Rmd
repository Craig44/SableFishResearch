# Initial model setup {#InitialModelSetup}
Use @punt2019spatial to outline the key considerations

- When did we choose to start the model and why. was it assumed to be in an equilbruim state
- What spatial regions did we start with and why
- How many fisheries
- What observations were included? how were they initially weighted


## Model start time {-}
The start year for the current stock assessment is 1960. This is the earlest year in which catch is available. There is early sex-aggregated length composition from the Japanese longline fleet along with a CPUE index for that same fleet in the 60's/70's. The survey data doesn't kick in until mid to late 70's. Unfortunately catch is the most limiting data input, where we can only go back to 1977 before we loose information on regional catch be gear method (pers comms kari Fenske). For this reason 1977 was the start year for the spatial assessment model.



## Model spatial resolution of the model {-}
This section describes the decision making process we took in configuring an initial spatial model. The first consideration was whether to include areas outside of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and the Bering sea Aleutian islands region, which is the spatial extent for the current stock assessment [@goethel2021assessment]. Sablefish inhabit a broad spatial distribution from the northeastern Pacific Ocean from northern Mexico to the Gulf of Alaska. It is currently assessed by three assessment bodies, the first is the area of focus, being the Bering sea and gulf of Alaska [@goethel2021assessment], one off the west coast of Canada **(Cox et al. 2011)** and the west coast from California to Oregan **(Stewart et al. 2011)**. Given the complex juvenile life history coupled with long range movement capabilities of adults, the stock structure of sablefish has been a topic of extensive research.


A recent genetic study by @jasonowicz2017love, found no significant difference between samples off the west coast of US, GOA and bering sea (there were no samples off the west coast of Canada in this study), providing evidence for a single panmictic population. A recent morphometric study [@kapur2020oceanographic], found significant differences in fish traits such as length at age between samples from the west coast of US and GOA. These results were consistent with the findings from @tripp2012population. Tagging is another important information source, with extensive tag releases along the entire North Pacific. Tag recovery data provide evidence for a two stock hypothesis [@kimura1998tagged]. With a stock north of Vancouver Island and a stock to the south. 


For the purposes of this research, we will assume GOA and BS, hereinafter refereed to as the GOABS complex, is isolated (i.e., no movement in or out of this region) from Canada and the west coast of the US. Although there is evidence to include part of Canada (Figure \@ref(fig:TagRecoveriesOutsideRegion)). Due to practical considerations regarding data sharing and the time-frame of this research Canada was excluded. The focus of this research is to build and explore a spatially explicit model for the GOABS complex.

```{r TagRecoveriesOutsideRegion, out.width = '100%', fig.height= 6, fig.cap="Tag recoveries outside of stock boundaries, with release locations (bottom panel).", echo = F, eval = T}
include_graphics(file.path("Figures", "out_of_region_recoveries.png"))
```



The general approach taken, was to build an initial spatial model that had the finest spatial resolution possible and aggregate regions as data limitations and model convergence issues arose. This finest model spatial resolution was initially based on the input data set with the coarsest reported spatial resolution. Data sets have been reported at different spatial resolutions over time. In general, data are reproted at three levels of spatial resolution: latitude and longitude (high spatial resolution), statistical area (Figure \@ref(fig:spatialstatArea)) and larger fishery management boundaries (Figure \@ref(fig:spatialmanagementArea)). Input data sets and the spatial resolution available are described in the following table.


```{r spatialstatArea, out.width = '100%', fig.height= 6, fig.cap="Statistical and reporting areas for GOABS complex", echo = F, eval = T}
include_graphics(file.path("Figures", "alaska-fisheries-boundaries-map.jpg"))
```


```{r spatialmanagementArea, out.width = '100%', fig.height= 5, fig.cap="Fishery management plan boundaries. The Eastern Gulf is often reported at subareas split up be East/West Yakutat and sometimes Southeast.", echo = F, eval = T}
include_graphics(file.path("Figures", "NFMP_with_EGOA.png"))

Reported catch from commercial fishers seems to be the most limiting data set which has the coarsest reported spatial resolution (**check this statement**). For this reason, the finest spatial resolution we will consider is the fishery management plan boundaries (FMP) being, Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, Western Gulf, Central Gulf and Eastern Gulf i.e., five area model (Figure \@ref(fig:LLRegions)). Although this was determined by a reporting constraint, this is also the spatial resolution that ABC's are allocated for


In addition to the reported spatial resolution of the data, we need to consider if there is any spatial sampling stratification within a data set. Sampling designs that have spatially varying stratification and thus spatially varying sampling intensity, could be inappropriate to use for alternative spatial stratifications. Often post-stratified estimators are not as efficient or accurate as design based estimators that are consistent with the sampling design. Fortunately in this case, the independent survey design is systematic. This results in consistent spatial sampling with respect to space, and removes this concern when considering alternative regional boundaries.

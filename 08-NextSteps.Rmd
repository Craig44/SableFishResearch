# Next steps {#nextsteps}


- Down weight the tag data? try multinomial likelihood should remove the absolute F signal
- Reweight composition data, increase precision for survey index (not fitting well) or estimate spatial selectivities (relectunt to do this because I want regional differences to be due to movement)
- Split survey AF by country e.g., Japanese and Domestic series
- Tag mixing? any ideas 
- Profile recruitment parameters
- Reduce regions - split at 206 longitude based on regression analysis of LF's

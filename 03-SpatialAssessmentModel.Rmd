# Spatial stock assessment model for Alaskan sablefish {#spatialmodeldescription}
The latest published stock assessment [@goethel2021assessment] is a sexually disaggregated integrated age-structured model. Let \(\boldsymbol{N_{r,y,s}}\) denote a vector of ages in year \(y\) sex \(s\) in region \(r\) (the partition) i.e., \(\boldsymbol{N_{r,y,s}} = (N_{1,r,y,s}, N_{2,r,y,s}, \dots, N_{a_+,r,y,s})^T\).

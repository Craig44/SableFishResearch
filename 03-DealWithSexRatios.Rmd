# Exploring methods for sex ratios in age and length composition data {#sexratios}

One of the needed improvements is dealing with sex ratios in the compositional data. Currently there is no observational information on sex ratio in the Sablefish stock assessment (Chapter \@ref(modeldescription)) (Caveat is users can provide an observed sex ratio for observations etc which is similar to the approach in @ward2019assessing). I am aware of two approaches for supplying observations that will provide information on sex ratio. The was taken from Casal2 [@doonan2016casal2] which calculates proportions for a year to sum to one over sex and age. Catch at age (in numbers) for both sexes is denoted by \(\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y} = (\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y,1},\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y,2})\), where \(\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y,1}\) is the catch at age for males and \(\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y,2}\) is for females, and 

\[
\boldsymbol{P^k}_{a,y} = \frac{\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y}}{\sum_a \sum_s \boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y,s}}
\]


The second approach is to provide a specific sex ratio observation over all ages or lengths as done in the New Zealand rock lobster stock assessment [@webber2021rapid]. 


\[
R^k_{y,s} = \frac{\sum_a \boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y,s}}{\sum_a \sum_s \boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y,s}}
\]


A simple simulation experiment was conducted to explore the benefits of each approach. There were two OM scenarios that we wanted to explore, the first was that the true population had a 50:50 sex ratio and the observations had skewed sex ratios due to the selectivity i.e., availability to the survey fishery. Second the selectivity was constant for both sexes but the sex ratio was skewed at recruitment.

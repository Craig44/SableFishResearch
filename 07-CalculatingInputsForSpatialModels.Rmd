# Spatial model inputs {#spatialmodelInputs}

This chapter describes how raw age/length and catch data were utilised to derive assessment inputs for a myriad of spatially structured assessments. The chapter aims to standardize the methods so that we can easily re-work the data to be fit in an 1,2 or \(n_r\) area assessment model.


```{r LLRegions, out.width = '100%', fig.height= 5, fig.cap="The finest spatial resolution that we are considering for Sablefish assessment", echo = F, eval = T}
include_graphics(file.path("Figures", "Longline_areas.png"))
```


## Survey data {#surveyData}

### Abundance {-}
I am thinking, when it comes to the real data application that we apply a geo-statistical model-based estimator. Currently the survey is a systematic design (Do the visit the same locations each year? obviously ignoring the AI BS switching), but they use a stratified survey estimator for the population mean and variance. I am wondering if this will over state the precision?


<!-- (ref:sablefishsurveycatchcaption) A time-series of sablefish catch from the long line survey pooled over 50km by 50km grided cells -->
<!-- ```{r surveycatchgif, fig.cap="(ref:sablefishsurveycatchcaption)"} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("Figures/survey_catch.gif") -->
<!-- ``` -->

### Age-frequency {-}

```{r agesamples, out.width = '100%', fig.height= 5, fig.cap="Number of aged fish by sex, region and year", echo = F, eval = T}
include_graphics(file.path("Figures", "age_samples_by_year_region_sex.png"))
```


### Length-frequency {-}


```{r lengthsamples, out.width = '100%', fig.height= 5, fig.cap="Number of fish measured for length by sex, region and year", echo = F, eval = T}
include_graphics(file.path("Figures", "length_samples_by_year_region_sex.png"))
```

Planned date of completion is December 1 2022 Consider improvements i.e., sex disaggregated composition data or sex ratio observations (look at the rock lobster assessment) including age-length observations or tag-increment observations to estimate growth internally. Characterise both fishery and survey data to get an idea of data limitations when considering spatially explicit stock assessment model. Develop a spatially explicit estimation model in TMB that generalizes the current assessment model. This requires a lot of thought, especially how we want to integrate the tagging data (Chapter 4) "],["modeldescription.html", "Chapter 3 Current Stock assessment model 3.1 Symbol Notation 3.2 Model equations", " Chapter 3 Current Stock assessment model The latest published stock assessment (Goethel et al. 2021) is a sexually disaggregated integrated age-structured model. Let \\(\\boldsymbol{N_{y,s}}\\) denote a vector of ages in year \\(y\\) for sex \\(s\\) (the partition) i.e., \\(\\boldsymbol{N_{y,s}} = (N_{1,y,s}, N_{2,y,s}, \\dots, N_{a_+,y,s})^T\\). The general process model is sequential and follows the general Equation (3.1), \\[\\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol{N_{y,s}} = \\begin{cases} g\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right), &amp; y = 1959 \\text{ Initial model year}\\\\ f\\left(\\boldsymbol{N_{y-1,s}}|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right), &amp; y &gt; 1959 \\end{cases} \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\(g(.)\\) is the function describing initial conditions for the partition and \\(f(.)\\) is the function that applies populations dyanmics each year i.e., birth, death, growth and migration. See Section 3.1 &amp; 3.2 for a detailed description of \\(g(.)\\) and \\(f(.)\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) is the set of estimable (not all are estimated) parameters. 3.1 Symbol Notation Symbol Description \\(y\\) Year, \\(y = 1960, \\dots, T\\) \\(T\\) Terminal year of the model \\(s\\) Sex index \\(s \\in \\{1,2\\}\\) \\(r\\) Region index \\(r \\in \\{1, \\dots, n_r\\}\\) \\(n_r\\) number of modeled regions \\(a\\) Model age cohort, i.e., \\(a = a_0, a_0 + 1, \\dots\\) \\(a_{1}\\) Recruitment age to the model = 2 \\(a_+\\) Plus-group age class (oldest age considered plus all older ages) \\(n_a\\) Number of age classes modeled \\(a_+ \\ - a_1\\) \\(l\\) length class \\(n_l\\) Number of length classes \\(g\\) gear type index, i.e. longline survey, longline fishery, trawl fishery \\(x\\) log-likelihoos index \\(\\bar{w}_{a,y, s}\\) Average weight at age \\(a\\), year \\(y\\) and sex \\(s\\) \\(\\phi_{a,y}\\) Proportion of female mature by age and year \\(\\ln \\mu_{r}\\) Average log-recruitment \\(\\ln \\mu_{f}\\) Average log-fishing mortality \\(\\phi_{y,g}\\) annual fishing mortality deviation by gear (log space) \\(\\tau_{y}\\) annual recruitment deviation \\(\\sim LogNormal\\left(0,\\sigma_r\\right)\\) \\(\\sigma_r\\) Recruitment standard deviation \\(N_{a,y,s}\\) Numbers of fish at age \\(a\\) in year \\(y\\) of sex \\(s\\) \\(M\\) Natural mortality \\(F_{a,y,g}\\) Fishing mortality for year \\(y\\), age \\(a\\) and gear \\(g\\) \\(F_{hist}\\) Historical proportion of Fishing mortality \\(Z_{a,y}\\) Total mortality for year \\(y\\), age \\(a\\) \\(=\\sum\\limits_g F_{a,y,g} + M\\) \\(R_{y}\\) Total mortality for year \\(y\\), age \\(a\\) \\(=\\sum\\limits_g F_{a,y,g} + M\\) \\(B_{y}\\) Spawning biomass in year \\(y\\) \\(S^g_{a,y,s}\\) Selectivity at age \\(a\\) for gear type \\(g\\) and sex \\(s\\) \\(a_50\\) age at 50% selection for ascending limb \\(d_50\\) age at 50% selection for descending limb \\(\\delta\\) slope/shape parameters for different logistic curves \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) ageing-error matrix dimensions \\(n_a \\ \\times \\ n_a\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{A}^l_s\\) age to length conversion matrix by sex. dimensions \\(n_a \\ \\times \\ n_l\\) \\(q_g\\) abundance index catchability coeffecient by gear \\(\\lambda_x\\) Statistical weight (penalty) for component \\(x\\) \\(P^g_{l,y,s}\\) Observed proportions at length for gear \\(g\\) in year \\(y\\) and sex \\(s\\) \\(P^g_{a,y,s}\\) Observed proportions at age for gear \\(g\\) in year \\(y\\) and sex \\(s\\) \\(\\psi^g_{y}\\) assumed sample size for gear \\(g\\) in year \\(y\\) (for multinomial likelihood \\(n_g\\) Number of years that age (or length) composition is available for gear \\(g\\) 3.2 Model equations Initialisation (\\(g\\left(.\\right)\\)) \\[\\begin{align*} N_{a,1,s} = \\begin{cases} R_1, &amp; a = a_1\\\\ \\exp\\bigg( \\mu_r + \\tau_{a_1 - a + 1}\\bigg) \\exp-\\bigg( a - a_1\\bigg) \\bigg( M + F_{hist} * \\mu_{LL} * S^{LL}_{a,1}\\bigg), &amp; a_0 &lt; a &lt; a_+\\\\ \\exp( \\mu_r) \\exp-( a - 1) ( M + F_{hist} * \\mu_{LL} * S^{LL}_{a - 1,1})(1 - \\exp( M + F_{hist} * \\mu_{LL} * S^{LL}_{a - 1,1}))^{-1}, &amp; a = a_+ \\end{cases} \\end{align*}\\] Population dynamics (\\(f\\left(.\\right)\\)) Describe the annual cycle for the model Calculating numbers at length For each year that has a length based observation, numbers at length denoted by \\(\\boldsymbol{N^l}_{y,s} = (N^l_{1,y,s}, \\dots, N^l_{n_l,y,s})^T\\) (dimension of \\(\\boldsymbol{N^l}_{y,s}\\) is \\(n_l \\ \\times \\ 1\\)) were calculated for each sex. This involved multiplying the numbers at age through a age-length transition matrix denoted by \\(\\boldsymbol{A}^l_{y,s}\\) (dimensions of \\(\\boldsymbol{A}^l_{y,s}\\) are \\(n_a \\ \\times \\ n_l\\) and its rows must sum to 1). The calculation follows Equation (3.2), \\[\\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol{N^l}_{y,s} = \\left(\\boldsymbol{A}^l_{y,s} \\right)^T \\ \\times \\ \\boldsymbol{N_{y,s}} \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\(\\boldsymbol{N_{y,s}}\\) is a column vector of numbers at age (dimension \\(n_a \\ \\times \\ 1\\)) at the beginning of year \\(y\\) for sex \\(s\\). Catch at age Catch at age for gear type \\(g\\) denoted by \\(\\boldsymbol{C^g}_{a,y,s}\\) \\[\\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol{C^g}_{a,y,s} = \\frac{F^g_{a,y,s}}{Z_{a,y,s}} N_{a,y,s} \\left(1 - S_{a,y,s} \\right) \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] Determining selectivities for fisheries and surveys The ADMB model has a hard coded number of selectivities. Some of them relate to changes in the fishery and so represent time-varying blocks. We want to spell these out and simplify for the TMB model. There are nine selectivities labelled fish1, fish2, fish3, fish4, fish5, srv1, srv2 and srv10. label Selectivity description fish1 Longline selectivity from 1960-1994 fish2 Not sure if this is used, maybe this is used for srv6? fish3 Trawl selectivity from 1960 - \\(T\\) fish4 Longline selectivity from 1995 -\\(\\ IFQ_y\\) (\\(IFQ_y\\) can = \\(T\\) fish5 Longline selectivity from \\(IFQ_y \\ - \\ T\\) if there is post IFQ block srv1 Domestic Longline survey selectivity srv2 Japanese Longline survey selectivity Observations for fisheries and surveys label Relative Abundance description srv1 Biomass domestic longline survey uses both srv1_sel and srv10_sel srv3 Abundance domestic longline survey uses both srv1_sel and srv10_sel srv2 Biomass survey uses both srv2_sel and srv9_sel srv4 Abundance survey uses both srv2_sel and srv9_sel srv5 Longline fishery CPUE fish1_sel, fish4_sel, fish5_sel srv6 Japanese LL fishery CPUE srv7 NMFS bottom trawl survey (currently GOA only; fit in model) label Composition description ac_fish1 Longline Fishery Age Comp (sex aggregated) sc_fish1 Longline Fishery LF (sex dis-aggregrated) sc_fish3 Trawl Fishery LF (sex disaggregrated) sc_fish2 LF for japaneses Longline fishery (sex aggregrated) (basically a survey now) sc_fish4 LF for japaneses Longline fishery (sex aggregrated) (basically a survey now) fish_size LF From japaneses trawl survey?

Although there is extensive and long term tagging data, this information is not currently directly included in the stock assessment (Goethel et al. 2021). Recent movment studies on Sablefish i.e., Hanselman et al. (2015) have highlighted the dyanmic nature of Sablefish movement.

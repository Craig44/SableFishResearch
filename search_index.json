The objective is to develop and explore a spatially explicit stock assessment for Alaskan sablefish. However, there will be many other topics that I will likely only scratch the surface on. The following outlines the chapters in this document Chapter 2 is a list of objectives that we have set or accomplished during this research project. Some of our research cannot be in this book/repo due to the confidential nature of the data. This checklist should include tasks for the wider research Chapter 3 documents the current stock assessment model and assumptions (work in progress). This first is the first step of the project and helps me get a grasp of data and dynamics that are important Chapter 4 explores how to include sex disaggregated composition observations that can include sex ratio information. It conducts a simple simulation to investigate two different approaches than what is currently done in the assessment Chapter 5 explores how to parameterise fishing mortality. The current approach is to estimate an annual fishing mortality parameter for each gear. I feel slightly uncomfortable about this approach moving towards a spatial model as the number of estimated parameters will explode. This chapter looks at two alternative approaches that either derive fishing mortality estimates using a Newton Raphson solver which is borrowed from the Stock Synthesis “hybrid” approach (Methot Jr and Wetzel 2013) and Pope’s discrete approach (Pope 1972) which uses exploitation rates. All of these methods have been used in literature for decades and we don’t wish to identify a “best” methods. The aim is to do a simulation and make sure these two approaches are numerical stability and have good convergence properties under a range of fishing patterns. Chapter 6 describes the tagging data and how it can be used within a spatial model but also used in a panmictic model for informing population dynamics such as growth. library(TMB) #library(stockassessmenthelper) library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(reshape2) library(gridExtra) References "],["objectives.html", "Chapter 2 A list of objectives/milestones that we have set along the project life", " Chapter 2 A list of objectives/milestones that we have set along the project life Translate current stock assessment (Chapter 3) from ADMB to TMB.

Some of them relate to changes in the fishery and so represent time-varying blocks. We want to spell these out and simplify for the TMB model. There are nine selectivities labelled fish1, fish2, fish3, fish4, fish5, srv1, srv2 and srv10. label Selectivity description fish1 Longline selectivity from 1960-1994 fish2 Not sure if this is used, maybe this is used for srv6? fish3 Trawl selectivity from 1960 - \\(T\\) fish4 Longline selectivity from 1995 -\\(\\ IFQ_y\\) (\\(IFQ_y\\) can = \\(T\\) fish5 Longline selectivity from \\(IFQ_y \\ - \\ T\\) if there is post IFQ block srv1 Domestic Longline survey selectivity srv2 Japanese Longline survey selectivity 3.2 Observation equations Three are three observational types in the current Sablefish stock assessment - Relative abundance indices - Age composition (aggregated over sex) - Length composition (disaggregated by sex) These three observation types come from both fishery dependent i.e., observer programs and CPUE and fishery independent i.e., research surveys. Catch at age Fishery dependent catch at age observations for gear type \\(g\\) denoted by \\(\\boldsymbol{C^g}_{a,y,s}\\) are calculated as follows \\[\\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol{C^g}_{a,y,s} = \\frac{F^g_{a,y,s}}{Z_{a,y,s}} N_{a,y,s} \\left(1 - S_{a,y,s} \\right) \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] Currently all age observations are sex aggregated which means the model expected values before applying ageing error is \\[ \\boldsymbol{C^g}_{a,y} = 0.5 \\sum_s \\frac{\\boldsymbol{C^g}_{a,y,s}}{\\sum_a\\boldsymbol{C^g}_{a,y,s}} \\] why the 0.5? should be omitted going forward. Ageing error is then incorporated and the values are normalized so that they are proportions, before being passed to the multinomial log-likelihood function. Survey age composition is similar but instead of being a function of \\(F\\) it is calculated at the beginning of the year. For survey \\(k\\) the numbers at age are denoted by \\(\\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y}\\) and calculated following \\[\\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y} = p^s N_{a,y,s} S^k_{y,a,s} \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] I am not sure exactly what the timing of these surveys are, but do we need to account for som mid-year mortality? or changes in timing of the survey? if so we could easily replace \\[ N_{a,y,s} \\] with \\[ N_{a,y,s} \\exp\\{-p^k_y Z_{a,y,s}\\} \\] where,\\(p^k_y\\) is the proportion of mortality that we want to account for in year \\(y\\) for survey \\(k\\). The survey numbers at age are then adjusted for ageing error and normalised so they sum to one for each year. Relative abundance indices \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{I}^g_{y} = \\sum_s\\sum_a p^s N_{a,y,s} \\exp \\{-0.5 Z_{a,y,s}\\} S^g_{y,a,s} \\bar{w}_{a,y,s} \\tag{3.5} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\(\\bar{w}_{a,y,s}\\) is mean weight at age, this can be omitted if the observation is in numbers i.e., abundance instead of biomass and \\(p^s\\) is the proportion for each sex. This is currently a user input, but should be dealt within the model either as having different sex selectivities or through the sex ratio of recruitment. A list of slight improvements change how sex ratio is handled fishery dependent abundance indices i.e., CPUE change \\(N_{a,y,s} \\exp \\{-0.5 Z_{a,y,s}\\}\\) with \\(\\boldsymbol{C^g}_{a,y,s}\\) which is calculated in the catch at age observations. Catch at length For each year that has a length frequency observation, numbers at length denoted by \\(\\boldsymbol{C^l}_{y,s} = (C^l_{1,y,s}, \\dots, C^l_{n_l,y,s})^T\\) (dimension of \\(\\boldsymbol{C^l}_{y,s}\\) is \\(n_l \\ \\times \\ 1\\)) were calculated for each sex. This involved multiplying the catch at age (see above for how it is calculated) through an age-length transition matrix denoted by \\(\\boldsymbol{A}^l_{y,s}\\) (dimensions of \\(\\boldsymbol{A}^l_{y,s}\\) are \\(n_a \\ \\times \\ n_l\\) and its rows must sum to 1). The calculation follows Equation (3.6), \\[\\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol{C^l}_{y,s} = \\left(\\boldsymbol{A}^l_{y,s} \\right)^T \\ \\times \\ \\boldsymbol{C_{y,s}} \\tag{3.6} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\(\\boldsymbol{C_{y,s}}\\) is a column vector of numbers at age (dimension \\(n_a \\ \\times \\ 1\\)) at the beginning of year \\(y\\) for sex \\(s\\).

Currently LF’s are separated by sex (needed for the different growths) and age compositional data are aggregated over both sexes. Although LFs are disaggregated by sex and should (in theory) be sufficient to estimate sex specific selectivities. It is not ideal to use LFs to estimate age-based selectivities because older cohorts “smush” into single modes and age information is lost. Before developing a spatially explicit model stock assessment model, I wanted to tidy some loose ends that may come back and bite me in the proverbial butt once we explore the spatially sex disaggregated stock assessment model in anger. These things are exponentially more easier to deal with in “simpler” models. My general intention is to drop length data when we have well sampled age data, currently they both go into the model together. For age composition data I want to structure the observations so that there is potential information on sex ratio. The current assessment can be given information on sex ratio for generating model predicted values which is similar to the approach in Ward et al. (2019). Howver, I personally think this should be dealt within the model. I am aware of two approaches for supplying observations that in theory should provide information on sex ratio. The first (approach 1) was taken from Casal2 (Doonan et al. 2016). This treats sexed composition data for a year as a single proportion i.e., proportions across all ages and sexes sum to one for each year, \\[ \\boldsymbol{P}^k_{y} = \\frac{(C^k_{a,y,1},C^k_{a,y,2})}{\\sum_a \\sum_s C^k_{a,y,s}}, \\quad \\sum \\boldsymbol{P}^k_{y} = 1 \\] where, \\(C^k_{a,y,1}\\) is the catch at age (numbers) for males in year \\(y\\), age \\(a\\) and survey \\(k\\). \\(\\boldsymbol{P}^k_{y}\\) is a proportion vector that sums to one that covers both sexes and corresponding ages. The likelihood contribution for this approach follows \\[ \\boldsymbol{P}^k_{y} \\sim Multinomial(\\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{P}^k_{y}], N^{eff, k}_{y}) \\ . \\] where, \\(N^{eff, k}_{y}\\) is the effective sample size for this survey and year. The second approach (approach 2) is to treat composition for each sex seperately that is proportions at age or length for a sex will sum to one, but also provide a specific sex ratio observation over all ages or lengths as done in the New Zealand rock lobster stock assessment (Webber, Rudd, and Starr 2021). \\[ R^k_{y,s} = \\frac{\\sum_a C^k_{a,y,s}}{\\sum_a \\sum_s C^k_{a,y,s}}, \\quad \\sum_s R^k_{y,s} = 1 \\] and, \\[ P^k_{a, y,s} = \\frac{C^k_{a,y,s}}{\\sum_a C^k_{a,y,s}}, \\quad \\sum_a P^k_{a, y,s} = 1 \\ . \\] The likelihood assumptions for this model are, \\[ R^k_{y,s} \\sim Binomial(\\mathbb{E}[R^k_{y,s}], \\sum_s N^{eff, k}_{y,s}) \\] and, \\[ \\boldsymbol{P}^k_{y,s} \\sim Multinomial(\\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{P}^k_{a, y,s}], N^{eff, k}_{y,s}) \\ . \\] where, \\(N^{eff, k}_{y,s}\\) is the effective sample size. 4.1 Simulations!! To explore the utility of these two approaches we conducted a simple simulation using a sexually disaggregated age-structured model (see Section 4.1). The Operating Model (OM) used in the simulation assumed a 50:50 sex ratio during the recruitment process however the OM did assume different growth and selectivity among the sexes. 4.1.1 Results In summary both approaches resulted in similar estimates in selectivities and SSBs. I prefer Approach 1 as it is a single observation compared with Approach 2 which has two observation types, but this simulation showed at least within the very small assumptions explored here they resulted in similar performance. This was all I was after in order to move forward to the spatial model. Future research that was not considered in this simple simulation LF observations with sexual dimorphism in growth. A possible reason LF’s could be influencing assessment output is due to mis-specified growth à la Minte-Vera et al.

The black and red line in approach 1 will sum to one, where as the black line and red line in approach will each sum to one. Approach 2 has an extra observation which is the proportion male (not shown). 4.1.3 Scenario 1 The first simulation assumed the OM had 50:50 males and female sex ratio at recruitment, and selectivities were as described in the above OM section. We simulated 100 data sets for each of the two approach’s for sexually disaggregated compositional data outlined in the introduction. These were then fitted to in two EM’s, where the EM’s differed in the approach they used. Both EM’s estimated a scalar on the female selectivity that allowed females to be more or less selected compared to males for both the fishery and survey. This was done be introducing an estimable \\(\\alpha\\) parameter into the selectivity. Males selectivities were constrained to have a max value = 1 using, \\[\\begin{equation} S^{male}_a = 1/(1+19^{(a_{50}-a)/a_{to95})}) \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] where as the female was \\[\\begin{equation} S^{female}_a = \\alpha/(1+19^{(a_{50}-a)/a_{to95})}) \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] Although this scenario assumed both male and female had the same max selectivity I wanted to see the effect of estimating this additional parameter.

This was done by setting = 1.2 in Equation (4.2). A third EM (EM3) was introduced for Approach 1, which fixed the female = 1. This is often the default approach. This is a side interest on biases when assessments assume equal selection between males and females when in fact there is selectivity difference. true_pars$logit_f_alpha_f = logit_general(1.2, TMB_data$sel_alpha_bounds[1], TMB_data$sel_alpha_bounds[2]) EM 1 (using approach 1) ## max gradient from 100 simualtions = 0.09063815 Figure 4.4: Absolute SSBs, red line OM (truth), black lines are the estimated values form EMs EM 2 (using approach 2) ## max gradient from 100 simualtions = 1.558348e-05 Figure 4.5: Absolute SSBs, red line OM (truth), black lines are the estimated values form EMs EM 3 (using approach 1 with female fixed at \\(\\alpha = 1\\)) ## max gradient from 100 simualtions = 1.886556e-06 Figure 4.6: Absolute SSBs, red line OM (truth), black lines are the estimated values form EMs References "],["Fexplore.html", "Chapter 5 Exploring alternative fishing mortality parameterisations (F) Set up a simulation Other things to consider", " Chapter 5 Exploring alternative fishing mortality parameterisations (F) The current Alaskan sablefish stock assessment (Chapter 3) estimates annual fishing mortality values for each gear \\(g\\) denoted by \\(F^g_{y}\\). This parametersation poses to potential problems when considering future assessment models and spatial models. The first is, the number of parameters will increase as the number of gears increase. The fishery is currently going through a transformation whereby there is a switch from longline to pots. The second consideration is how to set this up in a spatially explicit model where catch have an added spatial dimension. There are two alternative approaches to the current approach which treat \\(F\\) as a derived quantity rather than an estimable parameter. The first is to use Newton Raphson method to solve for \\(F^g_{y}\\). This is the recommended approach in Stock Synthesis (Methot Jr and Wetzel 2013), termed the “hybrid” approach. The previous two methods assume the Baranov catch equation for mortality (Baranov 1918). An alternative is to assume Popes discrete formulation (Pope 1972) which uses exploitation proportions (sometimes called harvest rates or fishing pressure) and has a closed form solution. A good general overview on these methods can be found in Branch (2009). They describe and compared the continuous Baranov catch equation (Baranov 1918) with Pope’s discrete formulation (Pope 1972). Arguments for using the continuous case is that \\(M\\) and \\(F\\) occur simultaneously, also with the continuous case, \\(F\\) allows for multiple event encounters, this is assuming a fleet has the same selectivity and availability, that a fish that escapes one net can be caught in another. In contrast, the discrete formulation only allows a fish to be caught or escape from an instantaneous event. I have tried to summarize the benefits of the continuous equation in the following list, Allows the entire population to be caught (not sure this is that relevant) Allows simultaneous \\(M\\) and \\(F\\), no need to worry about order of operations. From a coding/practical perspective this is quite attractive. Once you have an F and M you can easily derive all mid-mortality quantities. Where as using a \\(U\\) approach you need save the population before and after to interpolate to derive mid-mortality quantities. The magnitude of \\(F\\) effects composition data, where as in the discrete case, composition is independent of the magniture of \\(U\\). Allows for multiple catch events of an individual Can fit to catch observations thus allows for uncertainty in catches. In practice the uncertainty/variance on catch is very small i.e., coeffecient of variations ranging from 0.01 to 0.1. This essentially states catch is observed with high confidence and in my opinion isn’t that much different to saying catch is known exactly. Note often this high precision on observed catch is needed in order to make the \\(F\\)’s identifiable. This high precision also muddies the “degrees of freedom” for the model. Although the \\(F\\)’s look like independent and free parameters they are heavily constrained by the assumptiosn on observed catch variance. The arguments for the discrete approximation is that there is an analytical solution for \\(U\\) and so is fast to calculate expected catch, where as \\(F\\) has to be either solved numerically or estimated as a free parameter (as mentioned earlier). Chris Francis’s wrote a response to this paper (Francis 2010) where he argues the discrete formulation does not preclude the multiple encounters and that only the data can truly tell us which catch equation is the best one to use. Need to make a point about how there may be Automatic differentiation issues with the \\(U\\) approach. Because there is an if(U &gt; 0.99) which can cause a fork in the chain rule which can equal a coding nightmare. The relationship between \\(F\\) (Instantaneous fishing mortality) and \\(U\\) exploitation rate for a simple scenario (single fishery) is illustrated in the following R code. ## Params ages = 1:20 R0 = 1000 M = 0.2 a50 = 3.4 ato95 = 2.4 A = length(ages) N_age = vector() N_age[1] = R0 set.seed(123) for(age_ndx in 2:A) N_age[age_ndx] = N_age[age_ndx - 1] * exp(-M) * exp(rnorm(1,0,0.5)) barplot(height = N_age, names = ages) # selectivity at age S_age = logis(ages, a50, ato95) ## No selectivity u_range = seq(0,0.8,by = 0.02) F_range = -log(1 - u_range) # 1 - exp(-F_range) # back calculate U ## the application throught time.

Although there is extensive and long term tagging data, this information is not currently directly included in the stock assessment (Goethel et al. 2021). Integration in age-structured models Growth estimation using the Laslett–Eveson–Polacheck (LEP) Going to investigate the use of “Laslett–Eveson–Polacheck (LEP)” based on Laslett, Eveson, and Polacheck (2002) &amp; Eveson, Laslett, and Polacheck (2004) as described in Aires-da-Silva et al. (2015). The idea is to use a single growth model that fits to two observational data sets (ideally within the assessment, however we will start outside for now. When including it in the assessment you will also have LF data to help inform growth). The first will describe age-at-length data from direct ageing. The second will be length increment data from tagging experiments. Age-at-length growth model We start by using the Richards growth curve following Aires-da-Silva et al. (2015) (but this could be extended). The Richards growth formulation follows \\[\\begin{equation} \\bar{l}_{a} = L_{\\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{p} \\exp \\{-K(a - a_0)\\}\\right)^{-p} \\tag{6.1} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\(\\bar{l}_{a}\\) is the mean length at age \\(a\\), \\(L_{\\infty}\\) is the asymptotic length, \\(K\\) is the growth coefficient and \\(p\\) is a shape parameter that is related to the ratio \\(\\bar{l}_{a} / L_{\\infty}\\) at the inflexion point. Tag recapture growth data Symbol Description \\(l_{1,i}\\) length of individual \\(i\\) at release \\(l_{2,i}\\) length of individual \\(i\\) at recapture \\(a_{1,i}\\) age of individual \\(i\\) at release. Denoted as \\(A\\) in Aires-da-Silva et al. (2015) \\(a_{2,i}\\) age of individual \\(i\\) at recapture \\(\\Delta_t\\) Time at liberty \\(\\Delta_t = a_{2,i} - a_{1,i}\\) Just one comment on notation!!! in most all the papers that use this method, they ignore the individual notation of \\(A\\). That is not an issue in general however it confuses me when they describe the prior on this. The sub-models for the release and recapture lengths follow, \\[\\begin{equation} l_{1,i} = L_{\\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{p} \\exp \\{-K(a_{1,i} - a_0)\\}\\right)^{-p} \\tag{6.2} \\end{equation}\\] and, \\[\\begin{equation} l_{2,i} = L_{\\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{p} \\exp \\{-K(a_{1,i} + \\Delta_t - a_0)\\}\\right)^{-p} \\tag{6.3} \\end{equation}\\] The above growth model assumes that we know the age at recovery \\(a_{2,i}\\). The problem we have is, we have 22 569 tag recoveries with length information but only a handful of these have been aged. This is dealt with by modelling \\(a_{1,i}\\) as a random effect i.e., \\(a_{1,i} \\sim LN \\left(\\mu, \\sigma^2\\right)\\). What confuses is me here is how to assign a hyper distribution like the one above for the random effect variables \\(a_{1,i}\\). \\(a_{1,i}\\) is expected to vary quite a bit because tagged fish at release have a broad length frequency and thus is expected to have a broad age at release?

An approximation was made when calculating the length at recovery. The length increment (\\(l_{\\Delta_t}\\)) was simulated using a Log Normal distribution with the median set based on the difference between mean length at release age and mean length at recovery age.

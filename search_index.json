The annual cycle follows, \\[\\begin{align*} N_{a,y,s} = \\begin{cases} p^s_{y} R_y, &amp; a = a_1\\\\ N_{a - 1,y - 1,s} \\times \\exp\\bigg( -Z_{a - 1,y - 1,s} \\bigg), &amp; a_0 &lt; a &lt; a_+\\\\ \\exp\\bigg( -Z_{a - 1,y - 1,s} \\bigg) + \\exp\\bigg( -Z_{a,y - 1,s} \\bigg), &amp; a = a_+ \\end{cases} \\end{align*}\\] where, \\[ R_y = \\exp\\{\\mu_r + \\tau_y + 0.5\\sigma_R^2\\} \\] Determining selectivities for fisheries and surveys The ADMB model has a hard coded number of selectivities. Some of them relate to changes in the fishery and so represent time-varying blocks. We want to spell these out and simplify for the TMB model. There are nine selectivities labelled fish1, fish2, fish3, fish4, fish5, srv1, srv2 and srv10. label Selectivity description fish1 Longline selectivity from 1960-1994 fish2 Not sure if this is used, maybe this is used for srv6? fish3 Trawl selectivity from 1960 - \\(T\\) fish4 Longline selectivity from 1995 -\\(\\ IFQ_y\\) (\\(IFQ_y\\) can = \\(T\\) fish5 Longline selectivity from \\(IFQ_y \\ - \\ T\\) if there is post IFQ block srv1 Domestic Longline survey selectivity srv2 Japanese Longline survey selectivity 3.3 Observation equations Three are three observational types in the current Sablefish stock assessment - Relative abundance indices - Age composition (aggregated over sex) - Length composition (disaggregated by sex) These three observation types come from both fishery dependent i.e., observer programs and CPUE and fishery independent i.e., research surveys. Catch at age Fishery dependent catch at age observations for gear type \\(g\\) denoted by \\(\\boldsymbol{C^g}_{a,y,s}\\) are calculated as follows \\[\\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol{C^g}_{a,y,s} = \\frac{F^g_{a,y,s}}{Z_{a,y,s}} N_{a,y,s} \\left(1 - S_{a,y,s} \\right) \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] Currently all age observations are sex aggregated which means the model expected values before applying ageing error is \\[ \\boldsymbol{C^g}_{a,y} = 0.5 \\sum_s \\frac{\\boldsymbol{C^g}_{a,y,s}}{\\sum_a\\boldsymbol{C^g}_{a,y,s}} \\] why the 0.5? should be omitted going forward. Ageing error is then incorporated and the values are normalized so that they are proportions, before being passed to the multinomial log-likelihood function. Survey age composition is similar but instead of being a function of \\(F\\) it is calculated at the beginning of the year. For survey \\(k\\) the numbers at age are denoted by \\(\\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y}\\) and calculated following \\[\\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y} = p^s N_{a,y,s} S^k_{y,a,s} \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] I am not sure exactly what the timing of these surveys are, but do we need to account for som mid-year mortality? or changes in timing of the survey? if so we could easily replace \\[ N_{a,y,s} \\] with \\[ N_{a,y,s} \\exp\\{-p^k_y Z_{a,y,s}\\} \\] where,\\(p^k_y\\) is the proportion of mortality that we want to account for in year \\(y\\) for survey \\(k\\). The survey numbers at age are then adjusted for ageing error and normalised so they sum to one for each year. Relative abundance indices \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{I}^g_{y} = \\sum_s\\sum_a p^s N_{a,y,s} \\exp \\{-0.5 Z_{a,y,s}\\} S^g_{y,a,s} \\bar{w}_{a,y,s} \\tag{3.5} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\(\\bar{w}_{a,y,s}\\) is mean weight at age, this can be omitted if the observation is in numbers i.e., abundance instead of biomass and \\(p^s\\) is the proportion for each sex. This is currently a user input, but should be dealt within the model either as having different sex selectivities or through the sex ratio of recruitment. A list of slight improvements change how sex ratio is handled fishery dependent abundance indices i.e., CPUE change \\(N_{a,y,s} \\exp \\{-0.5 Z_{a,y,s}\\}\\) with \\(\\boldsymbol{C^g}_{a,y,s}\\) which is calculated in the catch at age observations. Catch at length For each year that has a length frequency observation, numbers at length denoted by \\(\\boldsymbol{C^l}_{y,s} = (C^l_{1,y,s}, \\dots, C^l_{n_l,y,s})^T\\) (dimension of \\(\\boldsymbol{C^l}_{y,s}\\) is \\(n_l \\ \\times \\ 1\\)) were calculated for each sex. This involved multiplying the catch at age (see above for how it is calculated) through an age-length transition matrix denoted by \\(\\boldsymbol{A}^l_{y,s}\\) (dimensions of \\(\\boldsymbol{A}^l_{y,s}\\) are \\(n_a \\ \\times \\ n_l\\) and its rows must sum to 1). The calculation follows Equation (3.6), \\[\\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol{C^l}_{y,s} = \\left(\\boldsymbol{A}^l_{y,s} \\right)^T \\ \\times \\ \\boldsymbol{C_{y,s}} \\tag{3.6} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\(\\boldsymbol{C_{y,s}}\\) is a column vector of numbers at age (dimension \\(n_a \\ \\times \\ 1\\)) at the beginning of year \\(y\\) for sex \\(s\\).

Self test change some parameter containers. In the ADMB model the often share parameters between male and females. Particularly for selectivity parameters. However TMB will not allow us to fix/map parameters across different arrays or vectors. This means we will want to join the male and female selectivity parameter objects into a single object so that we can share parameters between the sexes. References "],["sexratios.html", "Chapter 4 Exploring methods for sex ratios in age and length composition data", " Chapter 4 Exploring methods for sex ratios in age and length composition data One of the needed improvements is dealing with sex ratios in the compositional data. Currently there is no observational information on sex ratio in the Sablefish stock assessment (Chapter 3) (Caveat is users can provide an observed sex ratio for observations etc which is similar to the approach in Ward et al. (2019)). I am aware of two approaches for supplying observations that will provide information on sex ratio. The was taken from Casal2 (Doonan et al. 2016) which calculates proportions for a year to sum to one over sex and age. Catch at age (in numbers) for both sexes is denoted by \\(\\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y} = (\\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y,1},\\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y,2})\\), where \\(\\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y,1}\\) is the catch at age for males and \\(\\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y,2}\\) is for females, and \\[ \\boldsymbol{P^k}_{a,y} = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y}}{\\sum_a \\sum_s \\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y,s}} \\] The second approach is to provide a specific sex ratio observation over all ages or lengths as done in the New Zealand rock lobster stock assessment (Webber, Rudd, and Starr 2021). \\[ R^k_{y,s} = \\frac{\\sum_a \\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y,s}}{\\sum_a \\sum_s \\boldsymbol{C^k}_{a,y,s}} \\] A simple simulation experiment was conducted to explore the benefits of each approach. There were two OM scenarios that we wanted to explore, the first was that the true population had a 50:50 sex ratio and the observations had skewed sex ratios due to the selectivity i.e., availability to the survey fishery. Second the selectivity was constant for both sexes but the sex ratio was skewed at recruitment.

Although there is extensive and long term tagging data, this information is not currently directly included in the stock assessment (Goethel et al. 2021). LaslettâEvesonâPolacheck (LEP) Going to investigate the use of âLaslettâEvesonâPolacheck (LEP)â based on Laslett, Eveson, and Polacheck (2002) &amp; Eveson, Laslett, and Polacheck (2004) as described in Aires-da-Silva et al. (2015). The idea is to use a single growth model that fits to two observational data sets (ideally within the assessment, however we will start outside for now. When including it in the assessment you will also have LF data to help inform growth). The first will describe age-at-length data from direct ageing. The second will be length increment data from tagging experiments. Age-at-length growth model We start by using the Richards growth curve following Aires-da-Silva et al. (2015) (but this could be extended). The Richards growth formulation follows \\[\\begin{equation} \\bar{l}_{a} = L_{\\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{p} \\exp \\{-K(a - a_0)\\}\\right)^{-p} \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\(\\bar{l}_{a}\\) is the mean length at age \\(a\\), \\(L_{\\infty}\\) is the asymptotic length, \\(K\\) is the growth coefficient and \\(p\\) is a shape parameter that is related to the ratio \\(\\bar{l}_{a} / L_{\\infty}\\) at the inflexion point.

That is not an issue in general however it confuses me when they describe the prior on this. The sub-models for the release and recapture lengths follow, \\[\\begin{equation} l_{1,i} = L_{\\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{p} \\exp \\{-K(a_{1,i} - a_0)\\}\\right)^{-p} \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] and, \\[\\begin{equation} l_{2,i} = L_{\\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{p} \\exp \\{-K(a_{1,i} + \\Delta_t - a_0)\\}\\right)^{-p} \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] The above growth model assumes that we know the age at recovery \\(a_{2,i}\\). The problem we have is, we have 22 569 tag recoveries with length information but only a handful of these have been aged. This is dealt with by modelling \\(a_{1,i}\\) as a random effect i.e., \\(a_{1,i} \\sim LN \\left(\\mu, \\sigma^2\\right)\\). What confuses is me here is how to assign a hyper distribution like the one above for the random effect variables \\(a_{1,i}\\). \\(a_{1,i}\\) is expected to vary quite a bit because tagged fish at release have a broad length frequency and thus is expected to have a broad age at release?

This was to ensure all recovered fish positively grew at a rate expected by the growth model (less than ideal but will do for now). \\[ l_{i,\\Delta_t} \\sim \\mathcal{LN} \\left(\\ln (\\bar{l}_{a_{2,i}} - \\bar{l}_{a_{1,i}}), \\sigma = cv\\right) \\] \\[ l_{2,i} = l_{1,i} + l_{i, \\Delta_t} \\] In theory we can now pass this data to our LEP model to back estimate growth parameters. setwd(file.path(&quot;TMB&quot;)) #sink(file = &quot;compile_output.txt&quot;) compile(file = &quot;LEPgrowth_model.cpp&quot;, flags = &quot;-Wignored-attributes -O3&quot;) #sink() dyn.load(dynlib(&quot;LEPgrowth_model&quot;)) #setwd(DIR$book) # data data = list() data$ages_from_age_length = individual_age_length_df$age data$lengths_from_age_length = individual_age_length_df$length data$lengths_at_release = individual_recovery_df$release_length data$lengths_at_recovery = individual_recovery_df$recovery_length data$time_at_liberty = individual_recovery_df$time_at_liberty / 365 data$ages_for_report = ages; data$p_bounds = c(-20, 20) data$t0_bounds = c(-6, 4) # parameters parameters = list() parameters$ln_cv_length_at_age = log(cv) parameters$ln_k = log(k) parameters$ln_L_inf = log(L_inf) parameters$logit_p = logit_general(p, data$p_bounds[1],data$p_bounds[2]) parameters$logit_t0 = logit_general(t_0, data$t0_bounds[1],data$t0_bounds[2]) parameters$ln_cv_length_release = log(0.1) parameters$ln_cv_length_recovery = log(0.1) parameters$ln_age_at_release = log(individual_recovery_df$release_age) parameters$ln_mu_age_release = log(3) parameters$ln_sd_age_release = log(1) obj_mixed_all &lt;- MakeADFun(data, parameters, random = &quot;ln_age_at_release&quot;, DLL=&quot;LEPgrowth_model&quot;) MLE_mixed_all = nlminb(start = obj_mixed_all$par, objective = obj_mixed_all$fn, gradient = obj_mixed_all$gr) MLE_mixed_all$convergence MLE_mixed_all_rep = obj_mixed_all$report(obj_mixed_all$env$last.par.best) MLE_mixed_all_sd_rep = sdreport(obj_mixed_all) plot(ages, MLE_mixed_all_rep$mean_length_at_age, type = &quot;l&quot;, lwd = 3, col = &quot;red&quot;, xlab = &quot;Age&quot;, ylab = &quot;Length (cm)&quot;, ylim = c(0, 240)) lines(ages, mean_length_at_age, col = &quot;blue&quot;, lty = 3, lwd = 3) legend(&#39;bottomright&#39;, legend = c(&quot;LEP obs error&quot;,&quot;True&quot;), col = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;), lty = c(1,2), lwd = 3) Next steps Check sensitivity to the model to starting parameters Repeat with different sample sizes Repeat with a truncated age-structure for the age-length data using a selectivity Look at Sablefish data and see if the LEP approach can be used to it Explore alternative growth models i.e., Schnute (1981) References "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).

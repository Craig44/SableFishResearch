- What effect loosing early time-periods has on the assessment advice. The spatial models started much later in the time-series than when significant exploitation occured, which is a common issue with spatial models due to historical data not haveing spatial resolution to be used. This early period coincides with the largest removals in the time-series which is thought to be valuable to observe for observering contrast and helping estimate stock production [@hilborn1979comparison] this claim is actually countered by @magnusson2007makes.
